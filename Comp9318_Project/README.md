# Fool a binary classifier
[Project_Description](https://github.com/zyjwarlock/Comp9318/blob/master/Comp9318_Project/COMP9318-Specs.ipynb)

Devising an algorithm to fool a binary classifier.

In this project, some texts are provided with two categories which is either positive or negative. The program aims to generate a binary text classifier, belonging to SVM family, which can identify which word has high weight in contribution to the classification of certain text, and modify the texts based on the result to influence the classified result in target classifier. This includes processes of word vectors transform(tf-idf), SVM model training, support vectors extraction and text content modification.
